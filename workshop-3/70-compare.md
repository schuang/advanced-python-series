- You're building on pure scientific Python stack (use CuPy)

**The Hybrid Approach:**
Many successful scientific computing projects use multiple frameworks:

**Bottom Line:**
PyTorch can serve as a GPU-accelerated NumPy alternative, especially if you need automatic differentiation. However, it carries ML framework overhead that may be unnecessary for pure scientific computing. For most non-ML scientific computing, CuPy offers better ergonomics and performance, while JAX is superior for gradient-based research. PyTorch shines in the middle ground: scientific computing that benefits from gradients but doesn't fit JAX's functional paradigm, or when ML integration is valuable.
