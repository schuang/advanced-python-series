# Workshop 3: Accelerating Your Code with GPUs

**Part of the series:** *From Scripts to Software: Practical Python for Reproducible Research*

Having learned how to write sustainable, object-oriented code and how to scale it across multiple processors, we will now explore how to dramatically accelerate your computations using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
