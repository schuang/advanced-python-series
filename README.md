# From Scripts to Software: Practical Python for Reproducible Research

## Series Overview

This workshop series will cover advanced Python programming techniques for scientific computing. The focus will be on practical applications and real-world examples to help researchers enhance their coding skills and improve the efficiency of their scientific computations. This workshop is for those who have some experience with Python scripting and want to learn how to write more robust and maintainable code for their research. We will follow a dual-track approach with two "golden examples" to cater to a diverse audience.

We recognize that many researchers rely on community-developed scientific code and libraries. Even so, understanding the "from scripts to software" principles of how these tools are built is crucial. This knowledge will empower you to better customize and extend existing tools, create your own solutions when none are available, and gain a deeper understanding of the software you use every day.
