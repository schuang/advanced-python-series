# Summary and Conclusion

## Key Takeaways

We assembled Laplacians, nonlinear residuals, and objective gradients that respect partitioned halosâ€”core mechanics for battery thermal models, seismic simulations, and power grids. We practiced gradient sharing and parameter updates with MPI reductions, providing the blueprint for integrating custom deep-learning workflows on HPC systems. We learned how to choose PETSc components (solvers, preconditioners, TAO strategies) via runtime options, enabling rapid experimentation without recompiling.

You can scale Python from a single workstation to shared clusters by combining `mpi4py`, PETSc, SLEPc, and TAO, matching the tools used in production HPC environments. Structured codes (DMDA) and unstructured meshes (DMPlex) share the same MPI-aware patterns. Swapping grids or physics modules does not require redesigning the solver flow. PETSc's layered architecture (Vec/Mat, KSP, SNES, TAO) unlocks linear solves, nonlinear PDEs, eigenvalue analysis, and optimization without rewriting your application. Data parallel ideas carry across domains: gradient reductions for machine learning mirror the collective communications in PDE solvers and graph analytics.

The MPI standard documentation provides authoritative definitions. The `mpi4py` guide covers API usage and code examples. The PETSc manual offers solver selection and configuration guidance.



## Final Thoughts

Keep iterating: start with small test cases, verify convergence and stability, then scale to regional or enterprise-sized problems. Lean on PETSc's documentation and mailing lists. When problems grow beyond single nodes, these tools and communities help you stay productive. Workshop 2 set the CPU-parallel foundation. Workshop 3 will layer GPU acceleration on top of the MPI concepts.


## Next in this series

Workshop 2 covered CPU-based parallelism. GPU acceleration builds directly on MPI concepts.

Workshop 3 will focus areas include GPU architectures and how to access GPU resources from Python.
