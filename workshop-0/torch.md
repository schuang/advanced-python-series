# PyTorch Tensors vs. NumPy Arrays

If you're familiar with NumPy, you're already halfway to understanding PyTorch's most fundamental data structure: the **tensor**. PyTorch was designed to have a look and feel very similar to NumPy to make it easy for data scientists and researchers to get started. However, under the hood, PyTorch tensors have a couple of superpowers that make them essential for modern deep learning.

This is not a comprehensive guide, but a quick introduction to the key similarities and differences.

## The Similarities: A Familiar Foundation

For users coming from NumPy, the PyTorch API will feel immediately familiar. The behavior of many core features is nearly identical, which is a deliberate design choice.

### A Familiar API

PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays are both N-dimensional grids of numbers, and the syntax for creating them and performing basic operations is the same.

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# --- Creation ---
np_arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
torch_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# --- Operations ---
np_result = np_arr * 5 + 2
torch_result = torch_tensor * 5 + 2

print("NumPy Result:\n", np_result)
print("PyTorch Result:\n", torch_result)
```

### Slicing and Broadcasting Rules

The rules for slicing and broadcasting are also identical to NumPy's.

**Broadcasting** allows you to perform operations on tensors of different (but compatible) shapes. The smaller tensor is automatically "broadcast" across the larger one.

```python
# The broadcasting logic is identical
matrix_torch = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
vector_torch = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30])
result_torch = matrix_torch + vector_torch # Vector is broadcast
print("PyTorch Broadcast Result:\n", result_torch)
```

Just like in NumPy, you sometimes need to manually add an axis to make broadcasting work (e.g., to add a column vector to a matrix). PyTorch provides two ways to do this:

1.  **Using `None` (The NumPy-like way):** A concise, direct port of the NumPy idiom.
2.  **Using `tensor.unsqueeze(dim)` (The explicit PyTorch way):** More verbose, but can be clearer about which dimension is being added.

```python
# Add a column vector to a matrix
col_vector = torch.tensor([10, 20]) # Shape: (2,)

# The fix: add a new axis to the column vector
# Option 1: Using None
result_none = matrix_torch + col_vector[:, None] # Shape becomes (2, 1)
# Option 2: Using unsqueeze
result_unsqueeze = matrix_torch + col_vector.unsqueeze(dim=1) # Shape becomes (2, 1)

print("\nResult using None:\n", result_none)
```


**Slicing** creates a **view** into the original tensor's data, not a copy. This is a key performance feature. **Modifying a slice will modify the original tensor.**

```python
# Create a tensor
original_tensor = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
# Create a slice (this is a view)
slice_view = original_tensor[1:3, 2:]
# Modify the slice
slice_view[0, 0] = 99
# The original tensor is also modified
print("Original Tensor after modification:\n", original_tensor)
```
> **Note:** Just like in NumPy, "advanced indexing" (indexing with a list or boolean tensor) creates a **copy**, not a view.

## The Key Differences: Superpowers for Deep Learning

There are two main features that set PyTorch tensors apart and make them the foundation of deep learning.

### 1. GPU Acceleration

A NumPy array lives in your computer's main memory (RAM) and runs on the **CPU**. A PyTorch tensor can be moved to a **GPU** to take advantage of its massively parallel architecture, which is orders of magnitude faster for deep learning calculations.

```python
# Check if a GPU is available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    # Move a tensor to the GPU
    tensor_gpu = torch_tensor.to('cuda')
    print("Tensor device:", tensor_gpu.device)
    # Operations on tensor_gpu will now run on the GPU
    result_gpu = tensor_gpu * 2
else:
    print("No GPU available.")
```

### 2. Automatic Differentiation (`autograd`)

This is the magic behind how neural networks learn. A PyTorch tensor can track the operations performed on it. This allows PyTorch's `autograd` engine to automatically calculate the gradients (derivatives) of a result with respect to any of its inputs, which is essential for training models. NumPy arrays cannot do this.

```python
# Create a tensor and tell PyTorch to track its operations
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
# Define a simple function
y = x**2 + 3*x + 1
# Calculate the gradient of y with respect to x (dy/dx)
y.backward()
# The gradient is stored in the .grad attribute of x
# For y = x^2 + 3x + 1, dy/dx = 2x + 3. At x=2, the gradient is 7.
print(f"Gradient at x=2 is: {x.grad}")
```

## Interoperability: The Best of Both Worlds

PyTorch and NumPy are designed to work together seamlessly. You can convert a NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor and back with **zero memory copy**. They will share the same underlying memory, making it incredibly efficient.

```python
# Create a NumPy array
np_array = np.ones(5)
# Convert to a PyTorch tensor (zero-copy)
torch_tensor = torch.from_numpy(np_array)

# --- They share the same memory!---
# Modify the NumPy array
np_array[2] = 99
# The Torch tensor is also changed
print(f"Torch tensor after modifying NumPy array: {torch_tensor}")
```
> **Note:** This zero-copy bridge only works for tensors on the CPU.

## Conclusion: When to Use Which?

-   **NumPy:** The default choice for general-purpose numerical and scientific computing on the **CPU**. It is the bedrock of the entire scientific Python ecosystem.
-   **PyTorch:** The go-to for **deep learning** or any task that requires **GPU acceleration** or **automatic differentiation**.
