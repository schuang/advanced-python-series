# Workshop 2: Scaling Your Science with Parallel Computing

**Part of the series:** *From Scripts to Software: Practical Python for Reproducible Research*

Now that you have a solid foundation in writing sustainable and object-oriented Python code, we will explore how to scale up your research by breaking the single-processor barrier. This workshop will introduce you to parallel computing, empowering you to tackle larger research problems.
