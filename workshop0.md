# Workshop 0: A Quick Introduction to Python for Scientific Computing

**Part of the series:** *From Scripts to Software: Practical Python for Reproducible Research*

This optional workshop is for those new to Python or who need a refresher on the basics. We will cover the fundamental syntax and concepts required to follow along with the rest of the workshop series.

### Learning Objectives

*   Understand basic Python data types and data structures.
*   Use control flow (loops, conditionals) to direct the logic of your scripts.
*   Write and call functions to create reusable code.
*   Get a first look at the structure of classes and objects.

## Part 1: Python Basics

*   **Variables and Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
    *   See example: [workshop-0-examples/01_data_types.py](workshop-0-examples/01_data_types.py)
*   **Data Structures:** `lists`, `dictionaries`
    *   See example: [workshop-0-examples/02_data_structures.py](workshop-0-examples/02_data_structures.py)

## Part 2: Control Flow

*   **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `elif`, `else`
    *   See example: [workshop-0-examples/03_conditionals.py](workshop-0-examples/03_conditionals.py)
*   **Loops:** `for`, `while`
    *   See example: [workshop-0-examples/04_loops.py](workshop-0-examples/04_loops.py)

## Part 3: Reusing Code with Functions

*   **Defining and Calling Functions:**
    *   See example: [workshop-0-examples/05_functions.py](workshop-0-examples/05_functions.py)

## Part 4: A First Look at Objects

*   **Classes and Objects:** A brief introduction to the basic structure of a class.
    *   See example: [workshop-0-examples/06_simple_class.py](workshop-0-examples/06_simple_class.py)

## Next Steps

With these fundamentals, you are now ready to proceed to **Workshop 1: Foundations for Sustainable Research Software**, where we will explore how to use these building blocks to write more robust and maintainable scientific code.
