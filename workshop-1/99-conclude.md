# Summary and Conclusion

## Workshop Overview

Today we covered foundations for sustainable research software:

- Transitioning from linear scripts to well-structured, reusable code
- Using Python functions and classes to organize scientific logic
- Packaging and distributing code for reproducibility
- Building software that scales beyond single-use notebooks

## Key Concepts Covered

### Functions: Building Blocks of Reusable Code

- Type hints improve readability and enable static analysis
- Function signatures define clear contracts (arguments and return types)
- Exception handling makes code robust and prevents crashes
- Default arguments and keyword-only arguments improve flexibility and clarity
- Proper function design follows single responsibility principle

### Classes: Organizing Complex Workflows

- Classes bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into coherent units
- Self keyword connects methods to specific object instances
- Instance methods operate on unique object data
- Class methods work with shared data across all instances
- Static methods provide utility functions without accessing instance or class state
- Inheritance enables code reuse and logical hierarchies
- Abstract base classes define contracts that child classes must fulfill
- Polymorphism allows functions to work with any object adhering to a common interface

### Why Classes Matter for Science

- Encapsulation protects data integrity
- Clear workflows make research reproducible
- Safe refactoring enables long-term project evolution
- Multiple independent analyses without variable interference
- Objects act as snapshots of specific analyses

### Modern Python Features

- Dataclasses eliminate boilerplate for data-holding classes
- Decorators wrap functions to add behavior (timing, logging, registration)
- Type aliases simplify complex type hints

### Packaging: Sharing Your Work

- Standard project structure: `src/` layout with `pyproject.toml`
- Build tool creates wheel and source distributions
- Two distribution methods: GitHub Releases or PyPI
- Version control with git tags ties releases to source control
- Semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch) communicates changes clearly

## The Development Cycle

Sustainable research software follows a continuous cycle:

1. Write code using functions and classes
2. Organize into modules and packages
3. Test locally before distribution
4. Version and release through GitHub or PyPI
5. Update and iterate as science evolves

## Reproducibility: Beyond Code Structure

True reproducibility requires:

- Well-structured code (functions and classes)
- Documented dependencies (requirements.txt, conda environment)
- Version control (git for tracking changes)
- Reproducible environments (conda, Docker, Apptainer)
- Clear installation instructions

## From Scripts to Software

The progression we covered:

1. Linear scripts → Functions (single responsibility)
2. Functions → Classes (encapsulation and state)
3. Classes → Modules (organization by topic)
4. Modules → Packages (distribution and reuse)
5. Packages → Released versions (reproducible science)

## Why This Matters

- Scripts work once; software works repeatedly
- One-off code cannot be trusted; structured code can be verified
- Floating variables break easily; objects maintain integrity
- Manual installations fail; packages install reliably
- Undocumented dependencies cause "works on my machine" problems

## Even in the LLM Era

These skills remain essential:

- You provide the design thinking LLMs need
- You validate and maintain generated code
- You make architectural decisions
- You ensure long-term sustainability

## Bottom Line

Sustainable research software requires:

- Functions over linear scripts
- Classes over floating variables
- Packages over emailed files
- Versions over "latest copy"
- Reproducible environments over "works on my machine"

Transform your computational research from fragile scripts into professional, reproducible, shareable software.
